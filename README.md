### Heating and cooling load profiles for various configurations of the VDI 6007 room
**Author:** Alexander Neubauer; Hermann-Rietschel-Institut; Energy, Comfort & Health in Buildings; TU Berlin

#### About
The data set was created for the article Relationship between feature importance and building 
characteristics for heating load predictions. In total there are 15552 different room variants with hourly heating and cooling loads over one year. The data set can be used for your own research.

#### Room description:
The heating and cooling load profile data set is generated by simulating a simplified room model. Two RC elements are used to represent the room. 
All exterior and interior components are combined into one equivalent element each. The floor area is 17.5 m² and the room has a south-facing exterior wall with a window. 
Modelling of the room is based on the boundary conditions of test case 5 of VDI 6007-1 [[1]](#1).
The consideration of radiation through the transparent exterior components is done according to VDI 6007-2 [[2]](#2). 
A detailed description of the room model is given in Lauster et al. [[3]](#3).
The modelling of the room is done with the modelling language Modelica in Dymola. The used room model is the thermal zone with two elements for exterior and interior walls model of the Buildings 
library [[4]](#4).


The weather data is from the International Weather for Energy Calculations (IWEC) for the German cities Berlin and 
Stuttgart. The rooms have two different specific heat capacities, a light one (50 Wh/m²K) and a medium one (90 Wh/m²K). 
The building is in use from Monday to Friday from 7 am to 5 pm. Internal heat gains occur during this time.
Outside this time, the internal gains are 0. The room set point temperature for heating is 20°C 
and the room set point temperature for cooling is 24°C. The heaters and coolers are ideal, so the temperature is always 20°C for heating and 24°C for cooling, between 20-24°C there is no heating or cooling.

#### File Naming
All files are under dataset and the naming is structured this way.
The files are subdivided according to room types (Table 1) and location. 
In the individual files, the heating or cooling load of a room variant and the possible features 
are contained in the columns. The time is defined in the index.

Identifier of the designation (selection options in Table 2):
- l_{}_{}_tm-{}_u-{}_g-{}_i-{}\_a-{}\_{} e.g. l_Berlin_room3_tm-l_u-2_g-0.3_i-0.5_a-2_Q_heater
- l = location: Berlin or Stuttgart
- tm = thermal mass: l (light) or m (medium)
- u = U-value index: 0 to 5, rt 1 = Nr. 1 in Table 2, rt 5 is Nr.6 in Table 6
- g = g-value: values from table 2 e.g. 0.15 or 0.75
- i = internal gains: factor from default internal gains (20.6 W/m²) e.g. 5.1 W/m²=0.25 or 30.9 W/m² =1,5
- a = air exchange rate: Values between 0.25 h<sup>-1</sup> to 1.5 h<sup>-1</sup>
- heating or cooling load: Q_heater or Q_cooler
